ActiveXen
=========

This is an approach to create an ActiveModel compliant wrapper for the Citrix
XenServer.

This is still work in progress and propably not really usable for now.

* API Documentation: http://docs.vmd.citrix.com/XenServer/6.0.0/1.0/en_gb/api/
* Other SDK variants: http://community.citrix.com/display/xs/Download+SDK

Note
====

The lazy object loading (and probably other areas of the code) are currently not thread-safe.

This library is in no way endorsed or supported by Citrix or XenSource and is provided as is. It is probably useful, but might also neuter your dog, sleep with your wife, and sell your house on eBay. So don't blame me.
